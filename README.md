Run game.py to run game with only real players. Update the end of the code for number of players.
Run gameAI.py to run the game vs trained AI. Make sure to specify number of real players and AI players at the end of the code. 
The trained AI is saved in the model folder with file format .pth. It includes separate guesser and player AI.

To train the AI using reinforcement learning run the gameAI.py with 5 AI:s and specify the game as training on line 189.

There can be some lines of code commented out in the AI version that are needed, this was uploaded some time after I last touched the code.
